# iFood Insights: Advanced Analytics

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of iFood marketing and customer data. The analysis explores customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and campaign responses to derive actionable insights for marketing strategy optimization.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and income distribution
- Identify correlations between financial metrics and purchasing behaviors
- Test hypotheses regarding customer income levels
- Develop predictive models for customer spending
- Uncover latent patterns in customer behavior through factor analysis

## Data Description
The dataset contains customer information including:
- Demographics (age, income, education, marital status)
- Purchase history across product categories (wines, meat, fish, etc.)
- Campaign acceptance rates
- Website and catalog engagement metrics

## Methodology
The analysis employs various statistical and machine learning techniques:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations of distributions and relationships
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between financial variables
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical validation of assumptions about customer income
4. **Regression Analysis**: Predicting wine purchases based on income
5. **Factor Analysis**: Uncovering latent patterns in financial behaviors

## Key Findings
- Income distribution analysis reveals distinct customer segments
- Strong correlations exist between wine purchases and other luxury food items
- Statistical testing confirms the average customer income differs significantly from $50,000
- Linear regression shows a positive relationship between income and wine expenditure
- Factor analysis identifies two underlying factors driving financial spending behaviors

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models including regression and factor analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Predictive modeling
- Factor analysis for dimension reduction
- Insightful business recommendations based on data
