# InternIntelligence: iFood Insights Advanced Analytics

## Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of Task 3 (Advanced Statistical Analysis) for the Intern Intelligence internship program. Using the [iFood Marketing Campaign dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data), I've conducted comprehensive statistical analysis to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in customer behavior data.

## Task Description
As part of the "Advanced Statistical Analysis" task, I've applied various statistical techniques to analyze customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and campaign responses to derive actionable marketing insights for iFood.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about:
- Customer demographics (income, age, education, marital status)
- Purchasing habits across different product categories
- Campaign acceptance rates
- Website and catalog engagement metrics
- Customer relationship duration

## Methodology
The analysis employs several statistical and analytical techniques:
1. **Data Exploration**: Visualizing distributions and examining correlations
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validating assumptions about customer income levels
3. **Regression Analysis**: Predicting wine purchases based on income
4. **Factor Analysis**: Identifying underlying patterns in financial behaviors

## Key Findings
- Income distribution analysis reveals distinct customer segments with varying purchasing power
- Strong correlations exist between wine purchases and other luxury food categories
- Statistical testing confirms the average customer income differs significantly from $50,000
- Linear regression shows a positive relationship between income and wine expenditure
- Factor analysis identified two underlying factors driving financial spending behaviors

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models including regression and factor analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Predictive modeling
- Factor analysis for dimension reduction
- Insightful business recommendations based on data

## Implementation Details
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains:
- Comprehensive data exploration and visualization
- Statistical tests to validate hypotheses about customer behavior
- Correlation analysis between financial metrics
- Linear regression modeling to predict spending patterns
- Factor analysis to uncover latent variables in purchasing behavior

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, several actionable insights for iFood's marketing strategy:
1. Target high-income segments with premium wine and meat products
2. Design specialized campaigns based on identified spending patterns
3. Increase focus on customers who have shown interest in wines, as they tend to spend more across categories
4. Develop personalized marketing strategies based on the identified customer segments
